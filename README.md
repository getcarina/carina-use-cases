# Proposal

## Title
Think outside the container

## Abstract
There is much more to Docker than just deploying your flagship application. Let's look at three use cases for Docker, going beyond the typical software development pipeline:

The Rackspace Cloud DNS product team is running a Hubot-based ChatOps bot on Carina to automate routine operational tasks in the open via a team-based chat.  The team successfully migrated this service from another provider and into Carina in under an hour from start to finish, including a datastore migration!

Rackspace's developer documentation is open to external contributors and has streamlined the editing process with a staging environment that previews the full site on-demand for pull requests. All of its infrastructure is hosted within Docker containers, managed by Ansible, on a CoreOS cluster.

HowToWhale is teaching Docker with zero-setup from the comfort of your web browser. Every user has an interactive sandbox, courtesy of JupyterHub which spins up a Jupyter server on the users's own Docker Swarm cluster.

Come away with ideas for how you can use Docker on the side, even if you haven't tackled Dockerizing your application.

## Agenda
* Intro: 5 minutes
* ChatOps with Nick: 10 minutes. How the CloudDNS team is using ChatOps on Carina
* Deconst with Ash: 10 minutes. How the Developer Experience team builds, tests and deploys our websites using Carina
* HowToWhale with Carolyn: 10 minutes. Learning Docker on with JupyterHub and Carina
* Q/A: 5 minutes
