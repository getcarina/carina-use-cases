Outline:

 * Deconst: What & Why
   - developer.rackspace.com, support.rackspace.com, getcarina.com, docs.rackspace.com
   - Before: different processes, different people
   - What we didn't want: "We're using X now, everybody conform or be abandoned"
   - Unify: infrastructure; content; templates, CSS, JS; search; metrics; logging
   - Keep separate: GitHub repositories; documentation formats
 * Preview comments!
   - From very early: need to preview rendered content before it goes live
   - Make a pull request on a content repository
   - Bot account will post a link to a staging site
 * System components:
   - Content service: API for storing and retrieving "metadata envelopes" by content ID (a URI)
   - Presenter: URL -> content ID, get the envelope from the content service, render it with a template
   - Stateless containers behind a CLB; can scale horizontally as needed
 * "Staging mode"
   - Content service: Envelope not found? Cut first path segment, request from "upstream"
   - Presenter: Ignore first path segment for content and template mapping purposes
 * Strider
   - Opensource CI/CD server
   - Run a sequence of processes in Docker containers that mount a workspace DVC
   - Docker is important here: Sphinx's conf.py or Jekyll plugins are arbitrary code!
   - The "Preparer" runs Sphinx/Jekyll shimmed to output JSON files
   - The "Submitter":
     - queries the content API to see what's new
     - build tarballs of new assets and new envelopes
     - POST to the content API
   - If the submitter submitted something, derive the destination link and post it to the PR
 * The future
   - Doctests! Spelling and grammar check, doubled words, match against a styleguide
   - Comment errors and feedback on the PR itself
   - Port to Carina
