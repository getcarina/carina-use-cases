<!--
Outline:

 * Deconst: What & Why
   - developer.rackspace.com, support.rackspace.com, getcarina.com, docs.rackspace.com
   - Before: different processes, different people
   - What we didn't want: "We're using X now, everybody conform or be abandoned"
   - Unify: infrastructure; content; templates, CSS, JS; search; metrics; logging
   - Keep separate: GitHub repositories; documentation formats
 * Preview comments!
   - From very early: need to preview rendered content before it goes live
   - Make a pull request on a content repository
   - Bot account will post a link to a staging site
 * System components:
   - Content service: API for storing and retrieving "metadata envelopes" by content ID (a URI)
   - Presenter: URL -> content ID, get the envelope from the content service, render it with a template
   - Stateless containers behind a CLB; can scale horizontally as needed
 * "Staging mode"
   - Content service: Envelope not found? Cut first path segment, request from "upstream"
   - Presenter: Ignore first path segment for content and template mapping purposes
 * Strider
   - Opensource CI/CD server
   - Run a sequence of processes in Docker containers that mount a workspace DVC
   - Docker is important here: Sphinx's conf.py or Jekyll plugins are arbitrary code!
   - The "Preparer" runs Sphinx/Jekyll shimmed to output JSON files
   - The "Submitter":
     - queries the content API to see what's new
     - build tarballs of new assets and new envelopes
     - POST to the content API
   - If the submitter submitted something, derive the destination link and post it to the PR

    <p>Number one need from the day we shipped: ability to see content before it's live</p>
    <p>Needs to be accessible to a wide range of potential contributors</p>
    <p>Don't assume everyone has a good Ruby, Python, Node setup locally</p>
    <p>Vagrant/local Docker cause more yak-shaving problems</p>
    <p>No "staging server": complicated git workflows, only one person can use it at a time</p>

    <p>Strider content build plugin runs two Docker containers in sequence</p>
    <p>First is the "preparer"</p>
    <p>An adapter between the host doc system and the JSON format the content service understands</p>
    <p>Writes assets and JSON documents to directories within a workspace volume</p>
    <p>Important to run in Docker, as a non-root user! Jekyll and Sphinx can both run arbitrary code</p>
    <p>Also keeps us from having to manage Ruby / Python / Node versions on the build host</p>
